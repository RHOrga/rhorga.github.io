From the 3th to the 5th of December 2021 the eighth Robotic Hamburg Open Workshop (RoHOW)
will be held by team HULKs. This year, the event will be entirely virtual.

The RoHOW is an educational and networking event of the Hamburg University of
Technology (TUHH) with students and scientists from all over the world that are
active in research on humanoid robots.

Teams of the Standard Platform League are invited to present their work in
lectures, lightning talks or workshops. The RoHOW is organized by students from
the RoboCup team <a href="https://www.hulks.de/">HULKs</a> of the TUHH.
