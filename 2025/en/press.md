### 2. Brief profile

The Robotic Hamburg Open Workshop (RoHOW) is a continuing education and networking event organized by the Hamburg University of Technology (TUHH) with
students and scientists from all over the world who are active in the field of humanoid robotics.
RoHOW provides a space to present and discuss current research results.
In particular, the event framework allows direct contact with the speakers in order to hold extensive discussions and ask questions directly.

This year, development teams from over ten universities are participating in RoHOW, including research groups from Italy, the Netherlands, UK, Ireland, and Germany.
RoHOW thus promotes cooperation and exchange between universities, creating inter-university working groups.

### 3. Event schedule

The central elements of the event are the workshops, talks, and discussion rounds.
In most cases, not all topics are determined before the conference but rather emerge on site, depending on the interests of the participants.
This method is similar to open space conferences.
The planning for the workshops and talks is also highly agile and is not fixed at the beginning of the event.
Specially developed software collects presentations and interested parties and then plans a schedule for each participant that is as free of overlaps as possible.

In addition, partners from industry are given the opportunity to present their work in guest lectures.

### 4. Background

The organizers are students from the [RoboCup Team at the TUHH](https://www.hulks.de).
Since its founding, the team has been conducting research into humanoid robotics and participates in the annual world championships as part of the international research project [RoboCup](https://www.robocup.org/).

The RoboCup aims to advance research in the field of artificial intelligence and robotics.
Soccer games in which robots play with and against each other are the focus of this research.
The soccer game makes it possible to compare the state of development and is considered a measure of artificial intelligence.
At the same time, it makes the current state of the art tangible and understandable for everyone.

### 5. Why hold RoHOW in Hamburg?

The city of Hamburg is ideal as a “gateway to the world of science” and therefore a particularly suitable venue.

The high density of RoboCup teams in northern Germany makes travel to the event particularly convenient.
Our city's airport also makes it easy for international teams to reach us.

The diversity of technology companies based in Hamburg and the surrounding area promotes cooperation, providing interesting insights and facilitating exchanges.

The modern Technical University also offers the best possible facilities for this type of workshop event.
Larger presentations can be held in the Auditorium Maximum.
Many other equipped rooms are available for discussion groups and workshops.
